							<p>
								I am an NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the Astronomy department at UC Berkeley. 
								I study the formation and evolution of galaxies by tracing the 
								metal content of massive quiescent galaxies over cosmic time. My primary research 
								advisor is <a href="http://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~mariska/Home.html">Prof. Mariska Kriek</a>.
								</br></br>
								I received my B.S. in Physics and Astrophysics from the University of Minnesota in 2019. 
								During my time in undergrad, I worked with <a href="https://homepages.spa.umn.edu/~mscarlat/">Claudia Scarlata</a> 
								and <a href="https://nbi.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/625553">Gabe Brammer</a> on the spatial 
								distribution of star formation in the WISP and 3D-HST surveys.
								</br></br>
								Outside of astronomy, I enjoy hiking, lifting weights, knitting, and eating Thai food!

								<h3> Elemental Abundances and Ages of z ~ 0.7 Quiescent Galaxies on the Mass-Size Plane: 
									Implication for Chemical Enrichment and Star-Formation Quenching</h3
								<br>In this Letter we derive the elemental abundances and ages of 65 quiescent galaxies 
									at z ~ 0.7 from the LEGA-C survey. We find that (a) at z ~ 0.7, more compact 
									galaxies are more metal rich, and (b) the metallicity of the quiescent galaxy 
									population evolves significantly between z ~ 0.7 and z ~ 0. These results 
									have implications for the chemical enrichment histories and star-formation quenching 
									of galaxies in the early universe. Namely, (a) the mass-metallicity relation is 
									driven by a galaxy's ability to retain its metal-rich gas, and (b) progenitor 
									bias combined with quenching via gas ejection, is key to explaining the observed 
									metallicity evolution.
